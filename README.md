# Stoplight-Safety-Tool
This is a Stoplight Safety Tool macro for players and GMs. Make sure to give players observer permissions, and then have them put it on their macro bar. Once activated, it gives them a choice of Green, Yellow, or Red lights. After they pick one, it will send an image to chat and play a sound effect.  For more information, open up the macro's code.


This macro will open a dialogue window that lets players send stoplight images to chat: green, yellow and red. Whoever sendsthe stoplight will be anonymous to everyone except the GM, who will get an automatic private message from the sender. Also whenever someone presses the yellow light or red light, a sound will play. Make sure to give observer permission to all your players for the macro, and have them drag it on to their macro bar at the bottom. For more cool RPG stuff, visit us at www.GrumpyCornGames.com
