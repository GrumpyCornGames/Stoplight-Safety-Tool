# Stoplight-Safety-Tool
This is a Stoplight Safety Tool macro for players and GMs. Make sure to give players observer permissions, and then have them put it on their macro bar. Once activated, it gives them a choice of Green, Yellow, or Red lights. After they pick one, it will send an image to chat and play a sound effect.  For more information, open up the macro's code.


This lightweight macro module allows players to quickly send stoplight images- green, yellow, or red- directly into the chat. The sender remains anonymous to everyone except the GM, who receives a private message automatically. When a yellow or red light is triggered, a sound effect plays to grab attention.

To use it, make sure to grant observer permissions to all players and have them drag the macro onto their macro bar at the bottom.
