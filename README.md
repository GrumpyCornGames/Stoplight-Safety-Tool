# Stoplight-Safety-Tool
This is a Stoplight Safety Tool macro for players and GMs. Make sure to give players observer permissions, and then have them put it on their macro bar. Once activated, it gives them a choice of Green, Yellow, or Red lights. After they pick one, it will send an image to chat and play a sound effect.  For more information, open up the macro's code.
